\title{Plot proportions for binary (logical) data with confidence intervals}
\usage{
\method{plot}{Desc.logical}(
  x,
  main = NULL,
  xlab = "",
  col = NULL,
  legend = TRUE,
  xlim = c(0, 1),
  confint = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object containing frequency information for a binary variable.
The object must provide absolute frequencies in \code{x$afrq} and
relative frequencies in \code{x$rfrq}. Only two-level data are supported.}

\item{main}{Plot title. If \code{NULL}, a title stored in \code{x} is used.
If still \code{NULL}, the name of \code{x} is used.
Use \code{NA} to suppress the title entirely.}

\item{xlab}{Character string giving the label of the x-axis.}

\item{col}{Vector of colors used for the plot elements. If \code{NULL},
a default color palette is used. Colors are recycled as needed.}

\item{legend}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), a legend explaining the
confidence intervals is drawn.}

\item{xlim}{Numeric vector of length two giving the x-axis limits.
Defaults to \code{c(0, 1)}.}

\item{confint}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), binomial confidence
intervals at levels 0.90, 0.95, and 0.99 are displayed.}

\item{...}{Graphical parameters passed to \code{par()}, such as
\code{cex}, \code{las}, \code{mar}, or \code{oma}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called for its
side effect of producing a plot.
}
\description{
Creates a compact graphical representation of a binary outcome showing
the observed proportion together with binomial confidence intervals.
The plot is designed for objects containing absolute and relative
frequencies of two-level logical data.
}
\details{
Optionally, confidence intervals at the 90\%, 95\%, and 99\% levels are shown,
along with a legend explaining the interval widths.

Graphical parameters supplied via \code{...} are applied globally using
\code{par()}.

The observed proportion is shown as a horizontal bar, with optional
confidence intervals overlaid as shaded rectangles. Confidence intervals
are computed as Wilson intervals.

The title is drawn in the outer margin to ensure consistent alignment.
