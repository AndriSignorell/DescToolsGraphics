\usage{
barText(
  height,
  b,
  labels = height,
  beside = FALSE,
  horiz = FALSE,
  cex = par("cex"),
  adj = NULL,
  pos = c("topout", "topin", "mid", "bottomin", "bottomout"),
  offset = 0,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{height}{either a vector or matrix of values describing the bars which
make up the plot exactly as used for creating the barplot.}

\item{b}{the returned mid points as returned by \code{b <- barplot(...)}.}

\item{labels}{the labels to be placed on the bars.}

\item{beside}{a logical value. If \code{FALSE}, the columns of height are
portrayed as stacked bars, and if \code{TRUE} the columns are portrayed as
juxtaposed bars.}

\item{horiz}{a logical value. If \code{FALSE}, the bars are drawn vertically
with the first bar to the left. If \code{TRUE}, the bars are drawn
horizontally with the first at the bottom.}

\item{cex}{numeric character expansion factor; multiplied by
\code{\link{par}}\code{("cex")} yields the final character size. \code{NULL}
and \code{NA} are equivalent to \code{1.0}.}

\item{adj}{one or two values in \verb{[0, 1]} which specify the x (and optionally
y) adjustment of the labels. On most devices values outside that interval
will also work.}

\item{pos}{one of \code{"topout"}, \code{"topin"}, \code{"mid"},
\code{"bottomin"}, \code{"bottomout"}, defining if the labels should be
placed on top of the bars (inside or outside) or at the bottom of the bars
(inside or outside).}

\item{offset}{a vector indicating how much the bars should be shifted
relative to the x axis.}

\item{\dots}{the dots are passed to the \code{\link{boxedText}}.}
}
\value{
returns the geometry of the labels invisibly
}
\description{
It can sometimes make sense to display data values directly on the bars in a
barplot. There are a handful of obvious alternatives for placing the labels,
either on top of the bars, right below the upper end, in the middle or at
the bottom. Determining the required geometry - although not difficult - is
cumbersome and the code is distractingly long within an analysis code. The
present function offers a short way to solve the task. It can place text
either in the middle of the stacked bars, on top or on the bottom of a
barplot (side by side or stacked).
}
\details{
The x coordinates of the labels can be found by using
\code{\link{barplot}()} result, if they are to be centered at the top of
each bar. \code{barText()} calculates the rest.

Notice that when the labels are placed on top of the bars, they may be
clipped. This can be avoided by setting \code{xpd=TRUE}.

\examples{

# simple vector
x <- c(353, 44, 56, 34)
b <- barplot(x)
barText(x, b, x)

# more complicated
b <- barplot(VADeaths, horiz = FALSE, col="steelblue", beside = TRUE)
barText(VADeaths, b=b, horiz = FALSE, beside = TRUE, cex=0.8)
barText(VADeaths, b=b, horiz = FALSE, beside = TRUE, cex=0.8, pos="bottomin",
        col="white", font=2)

b <- barplot(VADeaths, horiz = TRUE, col="steelblue", beside = TRUE)
barText(VADeaths, b=b, horiz = TRUE, beside = TRUE, cex=0.8)

b <- barplot(VADeaths)
barText(VADeaths, b=b)

b <- barplot(VADeaths, horiz = TRUE)
barText(VADeaths, b=b, horiz = TRUE, col="red", cex=1.5)


# position of the text
old <- par(mfrow=c(3,2), xpd=NA)
off <- c(10, 4, 1, 20, -15)

for(pos in eval(formals(barText)$pos)) {
  b <- barplot(x, offset=off, 
  main=gettextf("Textposition pos = '\%s'", pos), horiz=TRUE)
  abline(h=0)
  barText(x, b, x, offset = off, pos=pos, cex=1.5, horiz=TRUE)
}
par(old)
